		<p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
		<p>And there were alligators everywhere.</p>
		<p>The sound of the wind bashing against the windows triggered the alarms</p>
		<p>The alligators weren't scared by the alarm and started rushing towards the building.</p>
		<p>This caused a lot of panic and the residents were all running inside and closing all the doors</p>
		<p>The alligators magically morphed into an ethereal version of the Crocodile Hunter in his classic short shorts.</p>
